# Python-Project---Instacart
This analysis was completed for the CareerFoundry Python project using Instacart data. The Python Jupyter Notebook files for the analysis are included.

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to investigate the purchasing behaviours of Instacart customers through database analysis using Python. I explored weekly, daily, and hourly trends, grouped products into simpler pricing categories, investigated product popularity, determined customer loyalty, and explored customer demographics. 

## Data
The data used for this project included information about Instacart's customers, departments, products, and orders. The database was derived from “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping
Dataset 2017”, Accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

## Tools

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Software: Jupyter Notebooks, Excel

## Skills
Several analytical processes and tools were used in this project, including:
1. Importing libraries 
2. Conducting descriptive exploratory tasks
3. Data wrangling and subsetting - changing data types, renaming columns, creating data dictionaries, creating new dataframes based on criteria, and calculating variable frequencies
4. Conducting data consistency checks - finding and addressing mixed-type variables, missing values, and duplicates
5. Combining and exporting data - merging dataframes, creating and anlyzing merge flag frequencies, and exporting as pickle files
6. Deriving new variables using conditional logic - if-statements, loc() function, and for-loops
7. Grouping and aggregating data - creating flags and summary columns using groupby() function
8. Data visualization in Python - histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots within Python
9. Reporting on findings - summarizing analysis findings in shareholder reports
