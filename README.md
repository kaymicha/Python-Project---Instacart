# Python-Project---Instacart
Python Jupyter Notebook files for Instacart analysis

The purpose of this project was to investigate the purchasing behaviours of Instacart customers through database analysis using Python. I explored weekly, daily, and hourly trends, grouped products into simpler pricing categories, investigated product popularity, determined customer loyalty, and explored customer demographics. 

The data used for this project was derived from “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping
Dataset 2017”, Accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

Several analytical processes and tools were used in this project, including:
1. Importing libraries 
2. Conducting descriptive exploratory tasks
3. Data Wrangling and Subsetting
   
       a) Changing data types
   
       b) Renaming columns
   
       c) Creating data dictionaries
   
       d) Creating new dataframes based on criteria
   
       e) Calculating variable frequencies

5. Conducting Data Consistency checks

       a) Fixing mixed-type variables

       b) Uncover and deal with missing values

       c) Uncover and remove duplicates

6. Combining and Exporting data

       a) Merging dataframes

       b) Creating and analyzing merge flag frequencies

       c) Exporting as pickle files

7. Deriving new variables using conditional logic

       a) If-statements, loc () function, and for-loops

8. Grouping and Aggregating Data

       a) Creating flags

       b) Creating summary columns using groupby () function

9. Data Visualization

        a) Histograms, bar charts, line charts, and scatterplots within Python

10. Reporting on Findings

        a) Summarizing analysis findings in shareholder reports
